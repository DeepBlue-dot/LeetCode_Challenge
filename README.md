# LeetCode Daily Challenge

## Overview
Welcome to my LeetCode Daily Challenge repository! This is where I track my progress as I tackle one LeetCode problem every day to enhance my problem-solving skills and improve as a developer. 

## About LeetCode
[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is a popular platform for practicing coding interview questions. It offers a vast collection of problems ranging from easy to hard, covering various topics such as algorithms, data structures, dynamic programming, and more. Solving LeetCode problems is an excellent way to prepare for coding interviews and improve coding skills in general.

## Goals
- Solve one LeetCode problem per day.
- Understand the problem statement thoroughly.
- Develop efficient solutions and optimize them if possible.
- Test solutions with different inputs and edge cases.
- Document thought process, approach, and solution explanations.
- Track progress and reflect on improvements over time.

## Repository Structure
- Each problem solution is organized into its own directory.
- Inside each directory:
  - A README.md file explaining the problem, approach, and solution.
  - Code files (e.g., Python, Java, C++) containing the solution code.
  - Additional resources or notes if necessary.

## Progress
- [x] Day 1: Problem Name (Link to Problem)
- [ ] Day 2: Problem Name (Link to Problem)
- [ ] Day 3: Problem Name (Link to Problem)
- ...
- [ ] Day N: Problem Name (Link to Problem)
